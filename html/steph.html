After a little while she realized this was not the artistic direction she wanted to be taking and left to pursue a career in tattooing. Steph moved from Dunedin to wellington in 2015 to make this dream a reality. After a few months in the city she landed an apprentiship at Kakapo Ink, where she worked for two years.</p>
