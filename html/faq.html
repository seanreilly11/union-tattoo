			<button class="faq">When are you open?</button>
			<div class="panel">
				<p>Monday – Friday 10.30 till 18.00</p>
				<p>Saturday & Sunday 11.00-16.00</p>
			</div>

			<button class="faq">Do I have to make an appointment?</button>
			<div class="panel">
				<p>Sometimes it is possible to come in and get tattooed on the same day, but we can get very busy with bookings over certain periods. To make sure you can get your tattoo done on the day you want and by your chosen artist its best to book and appointment. Every tattoo is important to us, we like to make every tattoo individual and make all of our customers feel comfortable and give them the time they deserve, making an appointment helps us achieve this.</p>
			</div>

			<button class="faq">How do I make an appointment?</button>
			<div class="panel">
				<p>You must leave a non-refundable deposit for all bookings. To do this it is easiest to pop into the store, have a chat with your chosen artist about your tattoo idea then book your appointment. If you are travelling from further away it is possible to pay a deposit online and correspond via email or phone. You can also arrange a free consultation to discuss your design and ideas before you book your appointment, this is advisable for all larger scale work. Do arrange a free consultation, please use the form below.</p>
			</div>

			<button class="faq">Why do I have to pay a deposit?</button>
			<div class="panel">
				<p>The deposit you leave is non refundable but will be deducted from the total price of your tattoo. Leaving a deposit helps us get rid of the time wasters, We can get very busy in the studio, and sometimes we have to turn people away or book them in at a later date because we have bookings all day. we do not charge for consultations or drawings, so deposits are a guarantee and commitment. If you book an appointment and don’t turn up then you have prevented someone else from getting tattooed and wasted our artists time. We take a deposit to make sure people commit to their appointment time and turn up. Also a lot of the custom tattoos are drawn up after work, after hours in the artists free time which can take hours in some cases. When people don’t show up they have wasted time drawing a tattoo.</p>
			</div>

			<button class="faq">Will I lose my deposit if I cancel or don't turn up?</button>
			<div class="panel">
				<p>Yes you will, however we understand sometimes things happen that prevent people from turning up, if you can’t make your appointment please try to give us a least 48 hours notice and we can rebook you for another time and you won’t loose your deposit. If something terrible has happened to you on the day of your tattoo, phone us as soon as you can and we will try and rebook you.</p>
			</div>

			<button class="faq">How much will my tattoo cost?</button>
			<div class="panel">
				<p>There are a lot of factors to consider while pricing a tattoo, size, detail and placement all determine the cost of the tattoo, it is extremely hard to give an accurate quote for tattoos via email or over the phone so your best bet is to come in and chat with one of our friendly artists. We only charge hourly on tattoos over 5 hours. All other tattoos will be quote as a piece.</p>
			</div>

			<button class="faq">Can I bring my own design?</button>
			<div class="panel">
				<p>Absolutely, if you have a design you already have or a tattoo you have designed yourself then bring it in with you, if it is exactly what you want we can make a stencil directly from your design or we can re draw it for you so it is perfect.</p>
			</div>

			<button class="faq">I have an idea but I can't draw!</button>
			<div class="panel">
				<p>Don’t panic, we specialise in custom tattoos, so come in and have a chat with one of our artists, they will be able to draw your design for you, if you have reference pictures that is always good to help us know what you like and want your tattoo to look like but we also have lots of reference books we can look through together and get your idea out of your head onto paper and onto your skin.</p>
			</div>

			<button class="faq">Is there a minimum age requirement for Union Tattoo?</button>
			<div class="panel">
				<p>16 years old is the youngest we will tattoo, any client under 18 must come in with a parent or guardian and both provide valid photo ID in order to complete a parental consent form.</p>
