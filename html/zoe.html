			<p class="text align-left small__para">The owner of her tattoo studio discovered that she was an art student and immediately put her skills to good use drawing tattoo designs. This introduction started an obsession with tattoos and opened her eyes to tattooing as an art form and a career in which she could utilise her artistic abilities. Not long after she moved to another studio where she began tattooing full time.</p>

			<p class="text small__para">Zoe moved to wellington in 2013 working at skint ink where she worked for three years until the studio closed its doors and she joined us here at Union.</p>

		<div class="artist__para--center">
			<p class="text small__para">Zoe is a well rounded artist and can lend her hand to most styles, though at the moment she is enjoying tattooing linework and etching detailed pieces, her delicate and sharp fine line work are already becoming popular with our clients.</p>
